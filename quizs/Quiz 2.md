Quiz 2
======

Quizzes are _optional, but encouraged_. They are a good way to test your conceptual understanding, before diving into the programming projects. Consider each question below, then reveal the answer. If you didn’t get it right, consider why you may have had that misunderstanding!

_Note that “or” in this question refers to **inclusive**, not exclusive, or._

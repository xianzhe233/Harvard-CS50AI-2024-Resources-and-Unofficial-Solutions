Quiz 5
======

Quizzes are _optional, but encouraged_. They are a good way to test your conceptual understanding, before diving into the programming projects. Consider each question below, then reveal the answer. If you didnâ€™t get it right, consider why you may have had that misunderstanding!

Question 1
----------

**Consider the below neural network, where we set:**

*   _w0 = -5_
*   _w1 = 2_
*   _w2 = -1_ and
*   _w3 = 3_.

**x1, x2, and x3 represent input neurons, and y represents the output neuron.**

**What value will this network compute for y given inputs x1 = 3, x2 = 2, and x3 = 4 if we use a step activation function? What if we use a ReLU activation function?**

*   0 for step activation function, 0 for ReLU activation function
*   0 for step activation function, 1 for ReLU activation function
*   1 for step activation function, 0 for ReLU activation function
*   1 for step activation function, 1 for ReLU activation function
*   1 for step activation function, 11 for ReLU activation function
*   1 for step activation function, 16 for ReLU activation function
*   11 for step activation function, 11 for ReLU activation function
*   16 for step activation function, 16 for ReLU activation function

Question 3
----------

**Consider a recurrent neural network that listens to a audio speech sample, and classifies it according to whose voice it is. What network architecture is the best fit for this problem?**

*   One-to-one (single input, single output)
*   Many-to-one (multiple inputs, single output)
*   One-to-many (single input, multiple outputs)
*   Many-to-many (multiple inputs, multiple outputs)

**What would be the result of applying a 2x2 max-pool to the original image?**

_(Note: Answers are formatted as a matrix \[\[a, b\], \[c, d\]\] where \[a, b\] is the first row and \[c, d\] is the second row.)_

*   \[\[16, 12\], \[32, 28\]\]
*   \[\[16, 14\], \[32, 30\]\]
*   \[\[22, 24\], \[32, 30\]\]
*   \[\[14, 12\], \[30, 28\]\]
*   \[\[16, 14\], \[22, 24\]\]
*   \[\[16, 12\], \[32, 30\]\]
